- tutorial fertig schreiben

- import-image anschauen, nicht mehr failsafe

- Revise and document make-object und initargs behaviour.  Upon
  restore, initargs for transient slots are ignored now, but this is
  not completely thought out.  It would better not to log initargs for
  transient slots in the first place.

- tx-persistent-change-class does not maintain indices

- XXXX broken initialize-persistent-instance (?)

- Within anonymous transactions, circular dependencies are not
  correctly serialized.  If an object that is created in the anonymous
  transactions links itself to another object, it may fail to restore
  correctly.  See anon-circular-test.lisp for an example.

  The issue here is that the anonymous transaction is first completely
  read from the transaction log before the transaction is executed.
  When reading a change-slot-values transaction in an anonymous
  transaction that references an object that has been created in the
  same transaction, it fails to find this new object and deserializes
  it as NIL.

  The best solution to the problem is to actually execute the
  subtransactions of an anonymous transaction while reading the
  transaction log instead of first reading, then executing.  The
  downside of this is that if the anonymous transaction was written
  incompletely, it will be partially restored before the error is
  detected.  There needs to be a restart in place for anonymous
  transactions that makes it possible to easily truncate the txn log
  before the partially written anonymous transaction begins so that
  the user has a way to restore to just that point.
