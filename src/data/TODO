- text based encoding wieder fuer angenehmeres debuggen vielleicht (?)

x rollforward until, restore until, usw...

- tutorial fertig schreiben

- import-image anschauen, nicht mehr failsafe

- Revise and document make-object und initargs behaviour.  Upon
  restore, initargs for transient slots are ignored now, but this is
  not completely thought out.  It would better not to log initargs for
  transient slots in the first place.

- tx-persistent-change-class does not maintain indices

- XXXX broken initialize-persistent-instance (?)

- Within anonymous transactions, circular dependencies are not
  correctly serialized.  Thus, an object that is created in the
  anonymous transactions links itself to another object, it may fail
  to restore correctly.  See anon-circular-test.lisp for an example.
